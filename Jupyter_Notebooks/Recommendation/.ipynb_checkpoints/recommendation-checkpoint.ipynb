      "['1523', 'Large-Eddy Simulation of Mixing Characteristics in Strut Injectors', 'Soni, Rahul Kumar', 'De, Ashoke', 'PH.D.', 'AE', 'The primary objective of the present work is to investigate the mixing phenomenon in supersonic condition for application in Scramjet combustor. It is well-known that at higher supersonic speed the residence time of fuel and air is extremely short which poses a challenge to the self-sustained combustion. Efficient combustion is vital to the overall efficiency of the engine cycle. The literature review suggests the existence of an enormous volume of research for the supersonic injection strategy, however, to name few, the most studied configurations are normal and parallel injection techniques. However, in the present study, the parallel injection technique is investigated due to its superiority over the normal injection case. The parallel injector assures low total pressure loss and contributes towards to the overall thrust of the engine. Since the study involves numerical investigation, OpenFOAM a robust open source code, OpenFOAM is used to carry out the present research. The density-based solver based on the central scheme of Kurganov and Tadmor is tested as well as validated for various complex flows. As a part of the systematic validation study, backward facing step and supersonic cavity flow are simulated using the original solver where the dynamic Smagorinsky model based on two model coefficient is implemented in OpenFOAM. After this exercise, the multiple species solver is considered to represent the mixing characteristics in the strut injectors which is the ultimate goal of this Ph.D. work. To achieve this, original density based solver has been modified to include species transport equation. The strut based injector considered here was studied experimentally at the DLR Germany, and the data is available in open literature. The available literature on supersonic mixing layer suggests that the convective Mach number (Mc) is the most critical parameter that has the direct effect on the mixing. However, the literature also indicates that at the higher convective Mach number, i.e., at supersonic speeds, the mixing layer growth is inhibited. It is primarily due to the lack of coherence and the presence of three-dimensionality in the flow field. Since all the study reported in the literature is conducted mostly with the splitter plate arrangement, the initial part of the study focuses on studying a real strut based injector at two convective Mach number, three-dimensionality, and lip thickness constitute main parameters in the study. First set of simulation has been performed with the planar hydrogen jet for two strut geometry namely tapered and straight to demonstrate the role of convective Mach number. Two convective Mach numbers vary in such a way that the effect of compressibility on turbulence is moderate for one case (Mc = 0.37) and significant for the other (Mc = 1.4). The Mc =0.37 being very close to the incompressible regime and Mc =1.4 flow being at the high supersonic regime will experience a very different level of compressibility. The study reveals that the mixing layer growth gets enhanced for the higher convective Mach number as opposed to the existing knowledge in the literature. This leads to the question that which parameters affect the near-field mixing if convective Mach number has the least role to play. The study points out that irrespective of the convective Mach number, higher velocity gradient in the vicinity of the jet exit plays a significant role. The higher velocity gradient assures enhanced turbulence which is desirable for the diffusion of species. Also, the higher gradient confirms the presence of K-H instability which leads to the breakdown of vortical structures along the shear layer that facilitates the mixing process by entraining fluid from outside to the core region. The qualitative inspection of the flow field suggests the presence of quasi-two-dimensional roller type structures for the planar jet case. To further investigate the nature of coherent vortices Proper Orthogonal Decomposition and Dynamic Mode Decomposition are invoked. These modal decomposition techniques shed light into the spatial and temporal coherence. This exercise enlightens us on the role of the coherent motion in the flow and explains the role of the lip thickness at the strut base. Similarly, the effect of three dimensionality is investigated for both the strut at Mc = 1.4 by employing the multi-jet configuration distributed along the spanwise direction. The jet spacing between the square jets is varied to study the effect of the three-dimensionality. However, the study yields that local two-dimensionality in the near jet region had the positive impact on the near-field mixing. For the lowest jet spacing (two times jet height) the results were close to that of the planar jet arrangement. Hence, the most important outcome of the present research is the presence of large-scale vortices which dominate the mixing process in the near-field.', '2018', 'http://172.28.64.70:8080/jspui/handle/123456789/18281']\n",

A working model is developed and simulated using comprehensive governing equations coupled with chemical kinetic mechanism with the help of commercial software ANSYS FLUENT. The physical model for the simulations are decided on the bases of the information available in the literature, and it consists of an adiabatic combustor with a freestream, mass flow rate inlets and an atmospheric pressure outlet condition.  Numerical simulation is used to investigate the effects of variation of freestream Mach number and fuel injection pressure on the supersonic flow field with upstream injection. Three different free stream Mach number and fuel injection pressure cases are selected considering the experimental data available in open literature. For all cases, fuel-air mixing phenomena are investigated, as the mixing behavior of a combustor is very important to understand combustion process. Flow structures upstream and downstream of the injection port are also thoroughly examined in all cases. Moreover, quantitative analysis is performed using parameters like coefficient of pressure, total pressure losses and mixing efficiencies at various downstream locations to compare the performance of the combustor.  For the variation of Mach number cases, interesting observations are made where the shock waves show different inclination and declination angle, particularly for the low Mach number case the inclination angle is so low that the multiple shocks are formed that resembles hacksaw teeth. However, the mixing efficiency and total pressure loss for the low Mach number case show better performance than that of the other two higher Mach number cases. The effect of variation of injection pressure on the flow field is found to be prominent regarding fuel-air mixing and flow structures, but all the selected injection total pressure cases show almost similar performance. It is found that low injection pressure results in low mixing efficiency and higher total pressure loss as compared to the other two higher injection pressure cases. The present study demonstrates that the three-dimensional effect plays an important role for characterization of cavity based supersonic combustor with upstream fuel injections.', '2018', 'http://172.28.64.70:8080/jspui/handle/123456789/17844']\n",

The study clearly brings out this superiority of the elliptical jet over circular jet from mixing point of view. The quantitative and qualitative results of present study bring out that the generation of vortices from largest to smallest size with continuous variation in their size. The variations of the size of the vortices are due to the continuous variation of the radius of curvature of the elliptical orifice along its azimuth. This is responsible for the enhanced mixing in the elliptical jet compared to circular one. Among the different aspect ratios tested, elliptical jet with AR=experiences significantly higher mixing.

The effectiveness of air-tabs (secondary jets) as active controls for controlling the mixing characteristics of the Mach 2 axisymmetric jet (primary jet) has been investigated experimentally with the air-tabs placed diametrically opposite at the exit of the primary jet at an offset. The air-tab Mach numbers are maintained at Mach 1 and Mach 2 at different levels of expansions and the mass flow rate of the air-tabs is less than 5% of the primary jet mass flow rate. The effect of mass-flow rate of the air-tabs on mixing enhancement of the primary jet is also studied. To quantify the jet mixing characteristics, the pitot pressure along the jet axis is measured. The waves prevailing in the jet field were visualized using shadowgraphy.  The secondary jet is expected to behave as a virtual cylinder. There is vortex formation at the sides of the secondary jet injection, which induces the injected air to twist into the spiral structure by the greater momentum of the primary jet and bifurcate subsequently into two streams. Each stream corresponds to one half of the counter-rotating streamwise vortices, they form the main part of the streamwise vortices. This forms the only mechanism for mixing in this case. The results show that the control effectiveness of the air-tabs, may be related to the mass-flow rate, the expansion level of the air-tabs and the primary jet shock interaction with secondary jet. The mixing efficiency of air-tabs is related to the strength of the streamwise vortices formed which is influenced by the expansion levels of the primary and secondary jets and the extent of secondary jet penetration into the primary jet core. Since the primary flow is supersonic the interaction of the secondary jet with the waves prevailing in the supersonic core of primary jet also play an essential role in effecting the mixing characteristics.

The testmodel is a sharp cone with an included angle of 20°. A Mach 2.5 de-Laval andconvergent secondary nozzles are mounted flush with the surface of the cone. Forboth the secondary nozzles, throat diameter is 2.5 mm. Surface pressuremeasurements on the cone surface around secondary jet were taken. The primaryand the secondary flow pressures were varied to achieve different momentum fluxratios (J). Nitrogen gas was used as fluid for transverse jet injection, however toknow the effect of the type of secondary gas, tests were repeated with heliuminjectant through supersonic nozzle at Mach 2 freestream. It is found that, variationof centerline pressure at constant J, is insensitive to the type of injectant used. Atsupersonic freestream Mach numbers, pressure jump ahead of the injectionincreases with increase of J from 0 to 6, then it almost remains constant with Jbeyond 6. Pressure dip is observed in the wake of the secondary jet and the lowestpressure is recorded for highest J. Pressure recovers downstream of the secondaryjet and this recovery length downstream is the longest for highest J. It is observedthat, there are two pressure jumps upstream of the jet at Mach 6 freestream withsupersonic secondary flow.Flow visualization tests were conducted using schlieren and oil flow visualizationtechniques at freestream Mach number 2, 3 and 6 with supersonic secondary jet.Flow features viz. three primary separation lines and three dividing streamlineswere identified from the flow pattern obtained from oil flow technique. From theschlieren pictures, the flow features viz. primary separation and bow shock ahead ofthe jet, barrel shock with Mach disk and reattachment shock downstream of the jetare captured. At Mach 3 freestream with supersonic jet injection, strong lip shocksof the jet are also observed. At hypersonic freestream, the cone shock and the primary separation shock are interacting with bow shock ahead of the jet. Jetpenetration depth is measured at Mach numbers 2 and 3. The non-dimensionalizedjet penetration depth for supersonic and sonic secondary jet at Mach 2 freestream isproportional to J0.526 and J0.562, respectively. At Mach 3 freestream with supersonicand sonic jet, it is proportional to J0.622 and J0.69, respectively.

In most cases, the designer wishes to use a con.guration that ensures rapid mixing of the jet .ow with the surrounding .uid. In industry, jets .nd widespread applications in high-speed metal cutting procedures, air-conditioning systems, etc. However, their most signif\\xadicant application, requiring control of mixing, is in the .eld of aerospace technology where the jet forms an important part of the exhaust systems of propulsion units. In mixing devices such as combustion chambers, chemical reactors, etc., jets are re\\xadquired to enhance the mixing between the reactants at molecular level, for an e.cient chemical reaction. With air-to-air warfare becoming more complicated with the intro\\xadduction of sophisticated weaponry and radar systems, aircraft designers, these days are also concerned about the stealth capabilities of modern .ying machines. As such they are more inclined towards the use of complex nozzle geometries such as a wide, thin nozzle rather than a circular one. These nozzles generally provide a reduced infrared signature which is of prime importance since, most of the short range air-to-air and ground-to-air missile radars rely upon infrared sensors. The best way to ensure stealth capability, therefore, is to reduce the infrared signature/detectability by cooling the engine exhaust temperatures by an e.cient mixing with the surrounding cool air. This requires rapid mixing of hot exhaust gases with the ambient air through improved noz\\xadzle design and employing mixing promotion techniques at the nozzle exit. This may also help to reduce far-.eld noise. When a jet is used for mixing purposes, a large mass entrainment, especially near the nozzle exit, is desired. The technological challenge of mixing enhancement in the compressible .ow regime stems from the inherently low growth rate of supersonic shear layer. The problem becomes all the more complicated when the nozzles are operated under o.-design conditions. At high altitudes the jet is necessarily underexpanded, unless it is exiting from a variable area nozzle. It is well known that, an underexpanded jet leads to expansion waves at the exit of the nozzle which extend to the free pressure jet boundary and re.ect as weak compression waves. These compression waves coalesce to form intercepting shocks in the interior of the jet and thus, the core of an underexpanded jet is dominated by periodic shock-cell structures. The presence of these shock-cell structures results in additional noise. From the above discussion, it is evident that, jet plays a dominant role in many disciplines of engineering. Also, the jet needs to be controlled to serve e.ciently for any speci.c purpose for which it is employed. Thus, jet control becomes an inevitable part of jet research. However, even though a quantum of information is available in literature, accounting for core length reduction and noise attenuation with tabs, notches, grooves, and cross-wire, the physics of the mixing enhancement caused by these passive controls are not deeply probed into, especially in the sonic and supersonic regimes. With this in mind, the present investigation aims at evaluating the e.cacy of passive control in the form of mechanical tab, on mixing characteristics of sonic and supersonic jets and to apprehend the governing .ow physics and to capture the .ow structure, in the presence of di.erent levels of expansion at the nozzle exit.', '2006', 'http://172.28.64.70:8080/jspui/handle/123456789/77']\n",

The large and small scale structures present in the near exit region of a jet play crucial roles in its evolution and growth and therefore, in the final mixing process. The present study is divided into two parts. In the first, mixing of two separated non-reactive variable density jets is investigated using Particle Image Velocimetry and Schlieren Deflectometry techniques. The effects of buoyancy force and the axial separation distance between the two jets have been taken into account for the enhancement of mixing between the two jets. It is observed that, buoyancy combined with axial separation distance may serve as an useful passive control strategy for mixing enhancement between two separated jets. The latter part of this work deals with the study of synthetic jet based active control of a buoyancy dominated square jet. The effects of excitation voltage and modulation frequency are studied separately for a fixed Richardson number of the primary jet. Separated Jet Mixing Mixing of two variable-density jets, one of which is essentially a negatively buoyant jet (He) and the other a nonbuoyant jet (O2) is studied experimentally using digital particle image velocimetry technique for separated nozzle geometry. Two jets are separated from each other, i.e., He jet exit plane is located upstream of the O2 jet exit plane. Experiments were carried out keeping the nonbuoyant O2 jet at constant Reynolds number (Re2 = 245) and varying the Richardson number (Ri1 = 1.8, 4.7, 16.4) of the buoyant He jet. The interaction between two jets as a function of buoyancy strength of helium jet is investigated. The flow visualization images clearly demonstrate the growth and shape of buoyant jet as a function of Richardson number. Mean velocity and vorticity field results provide quantitative picture about the mixing and interaction between the two jets. The stream trace results show the flow structures, i.e., recirculation zone and foci of vortex structures as a function of Richardson number. The mixing between two jets takes place at far downstream region for low Richardson number (Ri1 = 1.8). At Abstract v high Richardson number (Ri1 = 16.4), the buoyant He jet is located near its exit plane without any direct interaction with the O2 jet. At the intermediate Richardson number (Ri1 = 4.7), the buoyant jet encroaches the nonbuoyant O2 jet at a favorable penetration distance and a good amount of mixing between the two jets take place. The jet growth results based on the y0.5-location development in the streamwise direction clearly demonstrate the interaction between the He and O2 jets in the interjet region. The entrainment coefficient, vorticity magnitude, and turbulent kinetic energy magnitude are maximum at the intermediate Richardson number (Ri1 = 4.7) demonstrating direct relationship among each other. The mixing between buoyant He jet and nonbuoyant O2 jet is a function of both shear between the two jets and the strength of buoyant plume. A potential benefit of using separated nozzles over the traditional coaxial ones is the controllability of mixing zones between two jets by controlling the distance between exit planes of the two nozzles. Effect of this separation distance is examined by keeping the O2 nozzle exit plane at two different downstream locations (L/d1 = 10 and 14, d1 is the diameter of the O2 nozzle) away from the He nozzle exit plane. Traditional laser schlieren and rainbow schlieren techniques are used as visualization tools as well as to extract molar concentration of oxygen at the inter-jet region between the two jets. This concentration information is used to obtain the relative mixing between the two jets under different conditions. The extent of mixing between the two jets is found to depend highly on the axial separation between the two jets. It has been observed that the jet mixing is higher for smaller axial separation between the two separated jets when the Richardson number of the He jet is relatively low. Synthetic Jet Based Mixing Control Mixing enhancement of jets takes into account the increased dilution of the jet-fluid through strategic entrainment of the ambient fluid, giving rise to improved growth and spreading of the jet. The synthetic jet based control mechanism used in the present study, consists of a resonant cantilever type oscillating member placed inside a rectangular cavity, which is periodically forced to produce the synthetic jet through an orifice at the cavity wall. One such piezo electric based synthetic jet is used to provide periodic excitation at one side in the near exit region of a buoyancy dominated square Helium jet. Laser schlieren deflectometry technique has been used to study the effect of excitation voltage and frequency of modulation on the deformation and spreading of the jet. The excitation voltage is varied as 30v, 40v and 55v for two different Richardson numbers of the primary Helium jet, namely, Rip = 0.2 and 0.1. At high Richardson number the jet has a stable recirculation zone. In the presence of synthetic jet at one side, vi Abstract the primary jet is observed to get alternately vectored to the side of synthetic jet. With the increase of excitation voltage, the effect of synthetic jet becomes more prominent and the jet penetration depth is found to be more. At lower Richardson number, the jet acquires its self-excitation mode. Interestingly, at low Richardson number, the effect of increasing excitation voltage is found to have a gradual stabilizing effect on the inherent instabilities of the jet. Schlieren visualization and RMS intensity distributions are used to demonstrate the effect of excitation voltage on the self-excitation frequency of the jet. The effect of amplitude modulation in terms of variable modulation frequency (fAM = 5 hz, 10 hz, 40 hz and 100 hz) is studied for Rip = 0.2. Modulation frequency is seen to have a strong effect on the penetration depth and instability of the buoyancy driven jet. It is observed that the penetration depth gradually decreases as the modulation frequency is increased. The RMS content of the jet is found to be the maximum when fAM = 5 hz.', '2009', 'http://172.28.64.70:8080/jspui/handle/123456789/11084']\n",

Results of wall pressure along the plate centerline and around the injection nozzle periphery are reported for a number of tests differing by main nozzle Mach number, secondary injection Mach number and the nozzle pressure ratio of the secondary jet. Shadowgraph visualizations documented the global characteristics of the interaction flow field. The quantitative and qualitative results are used to characterize the flow field on the plate due to the combined flow. The penetration and turning of the secondary jet is governed by the waves prevailing in the freestream flow and the expansion level of secondary jet, which is strongly influenced by the nozzle pressure ratio.

In order to achieve proper combustion, thrust development and reduction in the noise level, it is often desirable to control the inter-mixing between the jets and also the entrainment of the surrounding atmosphere. This, in turn, require a detailed study of the behavior of high speed jets.  The high speed jet flows exhibit several complex features such as the present of shock cells, acoustic coupling between neighboring jets, turbulent mixing, mutual interaction between the jets, and so on. In view of these complexities, it has been hard to characterize the behavior of compressible multijets and obtain various quantities of practical interest.  It is known that the behavior of free jets depends upon flow Reynolds number, Mach number, the exit to ambient pressure ratio, the nozzle geometry (i.e., axisymmetric, elliptic, etc.), the nozzle configuration (i.e., single jet or multijet) and the nozzle spacing in the case of the multijet configurations. However, there are no studies on high speed multijets available in literature regarding the effects of the above variables on multijet flow field structure and propagation.  In the present work, detailed experimental measurements have been carried out to investigate the behavior of compressible multijet configurations in the subsonic, sonic and supersonic regions. Supporting theoretical calculations have also been performed for supersonic situations. The objectives of the present investigation are:  1. To study the flow field of compressible high speed free jets.  2. To investigate the interaction and mixing processes among the jets in multijet configurations.  3. To study the effects of nozzle exit Mach number, stagnation pressure ratio, nozzle spacing as well as the nozzle configuration on the jet flow field. 4.

To analyse the flow structure and interaction of multiple.  Axisymmetric convergent and convergent divergent Laval nozzles were used. For jets from convergent nozzles the nozzle were arranged to give single jet, two jets in line, triple jets in an equilateral triangular configuration and four jets in the shape of a square configuration. In the case of supersonic jets from Laval nozzles, the same configurations were used except that, for the four jet configuration, the nozzles were placed in a diamond shape.  Measurements were using total pressure probes and a disc type static pressure probe. Flow field was also filmed using schlieren system. Measurements. Were carried out in the X-Y and X-Z planes at several stations downstream of the nozzle exit. Experimental results were obtained in the range of stagnation pressure values of 1.13 to 4 atmospheres. For jets from supersonic nozzles, only the overexpanded case was considered. The design Mach number was chosen as 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5.  This thesis is organized as follows. Chapter 1 highlights the main features and important practical applications of free jets. This chapter also describes the historical background and the literature available on various aspects such as turbulent mixing of incompressible jets, acoustic coupling of compressible jets, effects of nozzle geometry, interaction of multijets and so on. Measurement techniques used to analyse the jet flow are also discussed. In addition, numerical studies of supersonic free jets are reviewed.  Chapter 2 describes the test facility, the experimental models and the measuring devices. The details of the experimental procedure are provided along with a discussion o the experimental procedure are provided along with a discussion of the experimental precautions adopted. The accuracy of measurements has also been indicated fro each variable of parameter.  In chapter 3, results of convergent nozzle jets are presented for different configurations. Results for the subsonic, sonic and underexpanded sonic jets are compared with each other. The results are presented in terms of velocity/total pressure profiles, total pressure contours, decay and spreading rates. It is found that the flow field of compressible multijets consists of three distinct regions. i.e., the converging, merging and combining regions, similar to incompressible jet flow. The jets attract each other, mix and then combine to form a single jet. The main feature of the combined jet are independent of the nozzle configuration. The multijet flow decays more rapidly than a single jet, due to the large amount of entrainment associated with the multijet configuration.  In chapter 4, supersonic jets from overexpanded nozzles are described. The mean behaviour of the supersonic jets depends upon the initial flow condition. In the case of multijet configuration’s the structure of the supersonic jets is affected by nozzle spacing and nozzle configuration. The distinct features of supersonic jets are the existence of shock cells, Mach discs and the intercepting shocks. The nozzle configuration has a strong influence on all of them. The nozzle configuration alters the influence on all the them. The nozzle configuration alters the shock cell structure and therefore, the whole flow field of the jet is changed.  Chapter 5 describes the numerical technique, the governing equations and the method of solution. A code capable of handling the under and overexpanded jet flows in single and multijet configurations has been developed. The numerical model is successful in determining the jet boundary, the position and shape of the Mach disc as well as the intercepting shock. The interaction between supersonic jets is also handled by this code.  Finally, the overall conclusions from the investigations are summarized in chapter 6. the main advantages of using the present nozzle configurations are highlighted. It is recommended that such multijet configurations be considered in industrial applications since they are capable of enhanced entrainment from the surrounding and they generate more flow disturbances which are necessary for mixing purposes.', '1992', 'http://172.28.64.70:8080/jspui/handle/123456789/8932']\n",

Multijet configuration with central to surrounding nozzle diameter ration of 2 and inter - nozzle spacing of 1.27 times the central nozzle diameter has been considered in the investigation. Circular jets of Mach numbers 1.82, 3.10 and 3.61 were studied. The multijet configurations of three jets in a row and five jets with a central jet surrounded by four jets along two orthogonal diameters of the cent ral nozzle were considered in the present study. In addition to the multijets, the central jet characteristics also has been investigated for comparison.  It is found that the nozzle pressure ration has a dominant influence on both mixing and noise charact eristics of multi as well as single jet. For M j = 1.82 the three jet configuration seems to be suprior from mixing point of view. However, at lower NPRs multijets of M j = 3.1 show better mixing characteristics. At higher NPRs, five jets configuration for M j =3.61 is found to have significant mixing advantage over three jet configuration.  Thus, the jet Mach number and NPR play an important role on both mixing and noise characteristics of multijets.', '1998', 'http://172.28.64.70:8080/jspui/handle/123456789/1310']\n",

      "['12309', 'STUDIES ON FREE AND IMPINGING JETS', 'John, Theratil Ignatius', 'Rathakrishnan, E', 'PH.D.', 'AE', 'This thesis gives the results of experimental investigation carried out to examine the possibility of a unique length scale to obtain similarity of velocity profiles in the subsonic and underexpanded sonic free jet field right from the nozzle exit. The flow field has been investigated based on Mach number as well as measured pressure distribution. Contours of equal fraction of exit mach numbers were constructed and termed as iso-mach lines. The isomach lines exhibited positive as well as negative gradients. The positive gradients are due to the dominance of the viscous effects, and the negative gradients are due to dominance of the inertia effect. The half velocity width when plotted in the spatial field of iso-mach lines demarcated the jet field in two zones, namely the zone of dominance of viscous effects above the half width the zone of dominance of the inertia effects below the half width. The physical significance of the half velocity width is hereby established as follows the half velocity width demarcates the flow field into zones of dominance of viscous and inertia effects.               On comparing the iso-mach lines for a wide range of jet exist mach number from 0.2 to correctly expanded sonic jet, in steps of 0.2, the positive gradient iso-mach lines were found to collapse irrespective of the exit mach numbers. The negative gradient iso-mach lines show the effect of the initial inertia; iso-mach lines of lower exit mach number show lesser lateral and axial existent compared to those of higher exit mach numbers. Several length scales have been proposed have been proposed by various investigators in the underdeveloped region of the jet flow obtain similarity of the velocity profiles, but only one scale exists for the developed region. Since the positive gradient iso-mach lines collapse over a wide range of exit mach numbers, it was assumed that similarity exists in the mixing region of the jet field excluding the in viscid core region. The half velocity width in the entire jet field right from the nozzle exist was taken with respect to the edge of the lateral extent of the potential core in the underdeveloped region and with respect to center line in the region beyond the potential core. With this as the length scale completer velocity similarity of the flow field was established irrespective of the nozzle exit mach numbers. The similarity profiles in the mixing region exhibited normal distribution.         The flow field was also analyzed based with the measured (gauge) pressures. The isobars exhibited positive as well as negative gradients. The positive gradients are due to the expansion of the jet into the ambient, whereas the negative gradients are due to contraction or the retention of the initial pressure potential. The half pressure width was found to demarcate the flow field into zones of dominance of expansion above the half pressure width and zones of dominance of retention of the pressure potential below the half pressure, width. Defining a pressure scale in terms of the gauge pressure and the length scale in terms of the pressure width completes similarity of the pressure field was obtained. This pressure similarity also exhibited normal distribution.         The length scale for velocity similarity, the pressure scale and the corresponding length scale for pressure similarity was applied to the impinging jet field for exit mach numbers from 0.2 to correctly expanded sonic in steps of 0.2. The pressure and the velocity similarity in the impinging jet field was also found to exhibit normal distribution.             These scales were further extended to under expanded free and impinging jets having the under expansion levels Pr=Pe/Pa as 1.2, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.25. The similarity of the velocity and pressure profiles exhibited normal distribution for the under expanded jets also         The above scales were extended to bounded shear flows, namely flow over flat plate. The origin of the local axis for similarity was taken at the maximum velocity contour. The half pressure width and the half velocity as the length scale were defined with respect to the maximum velocity instead of the zero velocity at the boundary. The similarity obtained exhibited a fifth order polynomial variation. Similarity in the bounded shear flows and the free shear flows are compared. The bounded shear flow similarity switch to normal distribution the moment the boundary is removed. This indicates thorough mixing in the free shear flows as compared to bounded shear flows. Further, the length scales obtain in the above analysis are independent of Reynolds number schlichting [91].           The scales were also applied to redial wall jet flow which is a combination of frees hear and bounded shear flows. The inner region of the wall jet form the bounded shear flow, whereas a the outer region of the wall jet from the frees hear flows. Taking the location of the maximum velocity as the origin as before for defining the length scales, complete similarity of velocity profiles are obtained for the wallet field. Similarity in the inner region which is similar to the bounded shear flow and the outer region is similar to the frees hear flow. By the choice of these scales, the velocity similarity in the radial wall jet region is independent of the proposed by Glauert [38]. These scales are therefore universal and are applicable to a wide variety of flow fields, which are either bounded or free or a combination or a combination of both or if they occur in succession.          The wall surface pressure distribution exhibits positive pressure zones as well as alternate pressure zones. Similarity of the wall positive pressure zone exhibits normal distribution irrespective of the exit mach number or levels of under expansion. A force scale is also presented which exhibits similarity of forces on the wall for a wide range of mach numbers upto correctly sonic and for different nozzle wall distances. The normalized force for under expanded jets exhibits lower distribution as compared to subsonic to correctly expanded sonic jets. This is due to higher dissipation of energy across the potential core cellular structure.          In addition to the above mentioned analysis by actual measurements the free and impinging jet flow fields have been studied by visualizing them. For visualizing the under expanded free and impinging sonic jets schlieren technique has been employed and for the wall surface pressure field a surface coating techniques has been sued. From these pictures the effect of the jet mach number level of under expansion, and the location of impingement wall on the free jet cellular structure, the impingement cellular structure and on the stand-shock wave were clearly brought out. The wall surface coating revealed the information of the shear distribution on the impingement wall as a function of flow and geometrical parameters.', '1994', 'http://172.28.64.70:8080/jspui/handle/123456789/1516']\n",
